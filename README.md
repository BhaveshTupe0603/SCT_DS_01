# 🎓 Data Science Internship - Task 1  
**Skill Craft Technology | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

## 📌 Objective

This repository contains my submission for **Task 1** as a Data Science Intern at **Skill Craft Technologies**. The goal of this task is to perform **data visualization** on real-world datasets to understand the distribution of both **categorical** and **continuous** variables.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a **Spotify music dataset**, which includes metadata such as:
- `genre` (Categorical)
- `popularity` (Continuous)
- `duration_ms`
- And more...

This modern dataset reflects real user engagement and musical trends, offering a practical context for analysis.

## 📊 Visualizations

### 1. Categorical Variable: `genre`
- A horizontal bar chart was created to show the distribution of song genres.
- Enhanced with color gradients and count labels for clarity.

### 2. Continuous Variable: `popularity`
- A histogram was plotted to visualize the frequency of different popularity scores (0–100).
- Count labels and color mapping were applied for better interpretation.

## 🔍 Insights

- **Top Genres**: Comedy, Soundtrack, Indie, Jazz, and Pop are the most common genres.
- **Popularity Scores**: Most songs lie in the mid-range popularity (40–60), with fewer songs at the extremes.
